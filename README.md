# Drakengard-3-cheats

Here I will store some attempts for making basic cheats or whatever else for Drakengard 3 on RPCS3.

Currently, this repo includes a script that will let you fly around.
Flying into certain areas out-of-order may crash the game. Keep this in mind as RPCS3 currently does not have savestates working properly.

Here's a preview gif:

For using the script (control.py): Turn off any multiplayer games to not flag any anti-cheats. Get python (preferably 3.10), and cheat engine. Open up cheat engine and RPCS3. Run the game, get into a level, run the script, e.g. double click it. Follow its instructions.
